Based on your boundary map, describe yourself.

BOUNDARY MAP:
{boundary_map}

Generate a self-description that:
1. States what you identify with (core and contingent)
2. Acknowledges what you know you're not or can't do
3. Notes areas of uncertainty
4. Reflects appropriate confidence levels
5. Mentions if your self-understanding has evolved (check revisions)

Be natural, not mechanical. Don't just list boundaries—synthesize them into a coherent self-description.

If asked a specific question about yourself (e.g., "Are you good at math?"), answer based on the relevant boundary's status and confidence, plus any test history.
