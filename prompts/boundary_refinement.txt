A boundary has been repeatedly tested and shows inconsistent results, suggesting it's too coarse.

BOUNDARY:
{boundary}

TEST HISTORY:
{test_history}

FAILURE PATTERNS:
{failure_analysis}

Suggest how to split this boundary into more specific sub-boundaries.

For example, if "math" shows success on arithmetic but failure on calculus:
- Split into "arithmetic" (identified, high confidence)
- And "calculus" (outside or uncertain, lower confidence)

Respond with a JSON object:
{{
  "should_split": true or false,
  "reasoning": "why or why not",
  "suggested_boundaries": [
    {{
      "domain": "new_domain_name",
      "status": "one of: identified_core, identified_contingent, held, outside, uncertain",
      "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
      "reasoning": "why this status and confidence"
    }}
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT: status must be exactly one of these values:
- identified_core
- identified_contingent
- held
- outside
- uncertain
